# Solving_Suko
The Suko puzzle was created by Jai Gomer of Kobayaashi Studios, and is usually solved by hand.
The code provided here can be used to get Suko solutions within seconds (if you are feeling a bit lazy).

Below is an example of a Suko grid, where Q and C are scalars given in the puzzle. The variables *x<sub>i,j</sub>* are what we are trying to find.
You can use the following websites to get free Suko problems and test the code: <br/>
