# Solving_Suko
The Suko puzzle were created by Jai Gomer of Kobayaashi Studios.
The code provided here can be used to get Suko solutions within seconds (if you are feeling particularly lazy to solve by hand).

Below is an example of a Suko grid, where Q and C are scalars given in the puzzle. The variables *x<sub>i,j</sub>* are what we are trying to find.
You can use the following websites to get free Suko problems and test the code:
